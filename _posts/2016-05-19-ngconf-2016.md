In August 2015 I entered the ng-conf 2016 ticket lottery. Given entry to the lottery was free, I figured why not enter? There are tons of people who are going to try to get in, so it's unlikely I'll win a ticket, right? Wrong. The following March I received an invitation to attend. I was a little hesitant about pulling the trigger at first, but I'm glad to say that I decided to go. Here we come Salt Lake City!

I went to the conference with very little exposure to Angular 2.x and Typescript and a lot of exposure to Angular 1.x. At Jazz we use Angular 1.x on a day to day basis. Most of the talks were based around Angular 2.x. This post is a recap of the major topics of the conference that I found most interesting:

- [Differences between Angular 1.x and Angular 2.x](#differences-between-angular-1x-and-angular-2x)
- [Angular Universal](#angular-universal)
- [TypeScript](#typescript)
- [Observables and RxJS](#observables-and-rxjs)

And lastly, a [demo Angular 2.x application](#demo-angular-2x-application).

Let's get started!

# Differences between Angular 1.x and Angular 2.x

There are some major design changes between Angular 1.x and Angular 2.x. Here are some points on which I'll further elaborate:

- The digest cycle is no more
- Creating web components has been simplified
- Interactions with the DOM have been abstracted from the framework

## ZoneJS and the Digest Cycle
Angular 2.x implements a library called zone.js, which can create "execution contexts that persist across async tasks". Zone.js is a library that is independent of Angular, but it is used heavily within Angular 2.x. In short, zone.js provides a way for the browser to execute code before and after asynchronous tasks run. Angular 2.x uses zone.js for change detection. When data bound to a controller is changed by an asynchronous task, zone.js tells Angular to rerender part of the view to reflect the changed data. In Angular 1.x the digest cycle was used for similar purposes.

## Web Components

The Angular 2.x advocates designing your application as a hierarchy of web components. This is similar to the concept of directives in Angular 1.x. You may also be familiar with components as they were backported into Angular 1.5 in order to make a smooth upgrade path from 1.x to 2.x. If you're already using .component and/or web components, this is great news!

If you are not familiar, the a web component is a grouping of markup, logic, and styling that produces a piece of functionality. Components can range from things like a navigation bar to a scrolling list to a gravatar. The important part is that their behavior is encapsulated, they are reusable, and they are testable.

Here's an example Angular 2.x component, pulled from the documentation website:

{% highlight typescript %}

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

export class Hero {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template:`
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <h2>{{hero.name}} details!</h2>
    <div><label>id: </label>{{hero.id}}</div>
    <div>
      <label>name: </label>
      <input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">
    </div>
    `
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Tour of Heroes';
  hero: Hero = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Windstorm'
  };
}

{% endhighlight %}

There is a lot going on here. The first thing you probably noticed is that this is not written in JavaScript. It is a language called TypeScript. Read more about TypeScript [here](#typescript). While writing code in TypeScript isn't required to use Angular 2.x, the core development team uses it and recommends using it. With that out of the way, let's look at code here that may be new to an Angular 1.x developer.

First we're using the `import` keyword to load a function from a different module. In this case we're loading the `Component` function from the `@angular/core` module.

Next we're creating a class called `Hero` with properties `id` and `string`. The `export` keyword means that this class will be able to be imported and used by other classes, similar to how we've imported `Component`.

Then we're using the `Component` function as a decorator, as indicated by the `@` prefix. An object is passed into this function with a selector and a template. The selector is what you'll put in your markup to create an instance of this component. The template is an in-line multiline string. Backtics are used in ES6 to create multiline strings. You can, and should, put your templates in separate files when writing your own projects. This example is simply squeezing everything into a single file.

Lastly we're exporting the class AppComponent, which is the root component of the demo application. This is sort of like the `ng-app` directive that could bootstrap an Angular 1.x application. Inside of the app component class we just have a couple variables that will be used by the template.

## DOM Interactions

In Angular 2.x interactions with the DOM have been abstracted at a lower level in the framework. In Angular 1.x the framework relied on being bootstrapped within the context of a website. This is no longer the case. What this means is that Angular 2.x can run anywhere there is a javascript environment. This includes the ability to [pre-render templates on the server](#angular-universal), run as a desktop application inside of [electron](http://electron.atom.io/), or run as a [native application on iOS or Android](https://www.nativescript.org/). It also means that Angular 2.x can run within a web worker. These are all things that were not possible within Angular 1.x.

# Angular Universal

Angular Universal is a project to run Angular 2.x on the serverside in order to pre-render views. If you are familiar with Angular 1.x and other frontend frameworks you know that it can be a challenge to address things like site previewing, search engine indexing, and first load performance. If you request a webpage but don't run the frontend javascript you'll simply see unhydrated markup, like templating curly braces and arbitrary tag names.

This project renders the initial state of an application(given a specific URL) in valid HTML so that the first page appears as it would have if the frontend framework had processed the state of the application. Once the frontend receives the prerendered view it starts rendering all subsequent views.

Currently this is available for node.js and dotnet server environments. In the future support is planned for other backends as well.

# TypeScript

A hot topic this year was the adoption of TypeScript.

TypeScript is a language that is a superset of JavaScript. Its compiler can compile it down to ES5 JavaScript. It can also be compiled to other versions if so desired. TypeScript allows you to use features from ES6(aka ES2015) as well as ES7. It also introduces types, which allows for fantastic tooling. The type system is completely optional and, when compiled to JavaScript, does not cause runtime type checking. Further, if you want to start using types but you don't want to commit to a large refactor yet, you can set all of your variables to the `any` type and the compiler will let them through. In fact, if you don't specify a type on a variable the compiler will assume that it is of type `any` by default.

Let's revisit the example application on Angular's documentation website as an example.

{% highlight typescript %}

export class Hero {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Tour of Heroes';
  hero: Hero = {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Windstorm'
  };
}

{% endhighlight %}

In this snippet we're creating two classes: `Hero` and `AppComponent`. AppComponent has a variable called `Hero` that is of type `Hero`. That type is created as the class shown above. Also notice that the `Hero` variable has valid `id` and `name` properties, as `1` is a `number` and `'Windstorm'` is a `string`. If these properties did not match the specified types then the TypeScript compiler would complain to you. Also of note, your text editor can be configured to highlight type mismatch errors.

Some other valuable concepts that TypeScript introduces, among many others, are interfaces, inheritance, and generics.

Interfaces are used to create contracts in your code. If a class implements an interface, you have a guarantee that it has specific methods and/or properties on it. It is wonderfully useful to have this guarantee when working with larger codebases. Fatfingered a method name? Accidentally deleted a line? An interface could have easily saved you a debugging headache. You can implement an interface by using the `implements` keyword in a class declaration.

Both classes and interfaces can inherit from other classes or interfaces, respectively. You can use inheritance by using the `extends` keyword in a class or interface declaration.

# Observables and RxJS

Observables are a new, first class feature in Angular 2.x. An observable, similar to a promise, tells of some action that will complete in the future. One major difference between observables and promises is that observables can receive multiple values, whereas a promise is resolved or rejected a single time. Matthew Podwysocki gave a presentation at ng-conf that showed a very useful graph to explain this difference:

![Observables are just collections](/public/img/observables.png)

Observables follow a different pattern than promises. Rather than running a callback upon either success or failure, one must subscribe to receive each push of responses from an observables. The returned data can be run through various array-like methods, such as map, merge, scan, zip, etc.. Observables are ideal for modeling a series of data over time. Things like data returned from websockets or a timeline of the clicks that a user makes on a webpage.

RxJS stands for reactive extensions for JavaScript. It is an open source library being developed and maintained by Microsoft. It provides the observable asynchronous functionality used in Angular 2.x.
